<p>This summer I presented an automation tool I co-developed for the Ford Motor Company Business Unit at Yazaki North America. Built alongside my colleague <strong>Darren Tenka</strong>, the tool leverages <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> to streamline the engineering drawing review process. What once took ~128 hours now requires fewer than 16—an <strong>88% reduction</strong> in review time.</p>
<p>From this project, I took away three major lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> – embedding new software into an existing engineering ecosystem.  </li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> – collaborating across functions and presenting solutions clearly.  </li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> – writing clean, scalable documentation to ensure long-term maintainability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This experience also highlighted the value of mentorship and leadership. Hearing stories from executives like Scott Bowser and connecting with leaders such as Eric Varton reinforced the importance of networks in shaping careers. I’m deeply grateful to my team—<strong>Jeff Ward, Erika Sanchez Ruiz, Drew Bisio, Ron Rakotz, Nicholas Barnaby</strong>—and to <strong>HR</strong> for creating such a meaningful program.</p>
<p>Finally, a special thanks to <strong>Darren Tenka</strong> for being both an outstanding teammate and friend. This project was as much about collaboration and growth as it was about technical innovation.</p>
