    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:-4px;">
      <em>DECEMBER</em> is a performance-driven music video created for Lizette’s debut single.
      Designed as a dialogue-free visual narrative, the piece treats emotional restraint
      as its primary storytelling device — allowing gesture, framing, and silence
      to carry meaning rather than exposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set within a winter landscape, the visual world mirrors the emotional state of the song:
      closeness without clarity, warmth interrupted by absence, and the slow recognition
      that staying can hurt more than leaving. The video exists in the in-between —
      where connection feels real, but commitment never arrives.
    </p>

    <!-- CONCEPT & CASTING -->
    <h3>Concept & Casting</h3>
    <p>
      From its inception, the music video for <em>DECEMBER</em> was conceived as a purely visual work —
      absent of dialogue and conventional narrative structure. Emotion is communicated entirely
      through performance, spatial relationships, and pacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following an open casting process, <strong>Meekel T Riney-Kim</strong> was cast as the male lead.
      His grounded, understated presence became central to the video’s emotional tension,
      anchoring the quiet push and pull that defines the relationship onscreen.
    </p>

    <!-- COLLABORATION -->
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      Lizette first reached out in early fall with the initial idea for <em>DECEMBER</em>.
      After meeting in person during a separate creative shoot, the project quickly evolved
      into a collaborative process rooted in trust, vulnerability, and shared emotional clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than relying on a rigid shot list, the production remained intentionally flexible —
      allowing weather, environment, and performance to shape the final visual language.
    </p>

    <!-- STORYBOARD & ITINERARY -->
    <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:-4px;">
      The music video for <em>DECEMBER</em> was structured as an emotional timeline aligned
      with the song’s progression, rather than a traditional narrative arc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storyboard emphasized recurring visual motifs — isolation, proximity, and rupture —
      moving between night exteriors, intimate interior moments, and daylight distance.
      Key sequences were designed to escalate from stillness into motion before returning
      to restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoot itinerary followed natural winter light: interior apartment scenes,
      downtown B-roll and slow motion, dockside sequences at sunset,
      and isolated night exteriors to close the day.
    </p>

    <!-- INTERVIEW -->
    <h3>Artist & Director Interview</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:-4px;">
      An excerpt from a filmed conversation between Lizette and director PJ Kim,
      recorded during production.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Lizette:</strong> It’s about the ache of being half-chosen by someone you’d choose every day.</p>

      <p>
        It’s about being caught between closeness and distance with someone who says
        they care about you, but doesn’t make the effort to prove it —
        in other words, a situationship.
      </p>

      <p><strong>PJ:</strong> What inspired you to write <em>DECEMBER</em>?</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lizette:</strong> I wrote this song in December of 2022 during a late night
        where I was missing someone I wasn’t even sure missed me back.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanted to capture the confusion of feeling wanted one moment
        and invisible the next — set within an emotional winter where
        you realize you have to let go, even though every part of you still wants them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>DECEMBER</em> is about begging yourself — and this person —
        to let the connection die because it’s hurting more than it’s healing.
      </p>

      <p><strong>PJ:</strong> What was the hardest part?</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lizette:</strong> Being vulnerable enough to share it.
        Learning to trust other creatives and collaborate
        was what ultimately made this project possible.
      </p>

    <h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:-4px;">
      Shot over a winter weekend in the snow, the production remained intentionally small
      to preserve focus and emotional proximity. The cold environment became an active
      component of the performance, shaping movement, pacing, and stillness.

    <!-- DIRECTOR NOTE -->
    <h3>Director’s Note</h3>
    <p>
      My goal as a director is to create visual spaces where artists
      can express stories that are often felt but rarely articulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With <em>DECEMBER</em>, the intention was to support Lizette’s voice —
      translating the emotional core of her debut single into a visual language
      that honors restraint, vulnerability, and honesty.
