    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The technological acceleration outpaces our societal and educational infrastructure,
      creating a lack of meaningful resources to manage and understand the porn that saturates
      the internet. Porn is a primary source of sex education, and it reinforces patriarchal roles,
      exemplified by the observation that “mainstream porn is, bluntly put, porn made by men
      for men” (Reiss &amp; Dahlman). My proposed solution to this problem (while not a main
      focus in this paper) is a comprehensive and destigmatized sex education enforced in
      schools. In this paper, I aim to investigate how gender roles are reinforced in mainstream
      pornography, and how the rapid expansion of technology contributes to the normalization—
      and often unregulated spread—of these representations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I review key scholarly and peer-reviewed literature—including works by Reiss and
      Dahlman (2024), Sunčič (2013), Cardoso and Paasonen (2020), and Corsianos (2007)—to
      examine the intersection of pornography, technology, and the reinforcement of gendered
      and patriarchal norms. To frame this discussion, I draw on Andrea Dworkin’s radical
      feminist theory as a foundational lens. My methodology centers on intersectional analysis, a
      framework that explores how overlapping dimensions of identity—such as gender, race,
      class, and sexuality—interact to shape individual experiences of power, marginalization,
      and privilege.
    </p>

    <!-- THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK -->
    <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>
    <p>
      “A New Kind of Death” by Rose A. Owen analyzes rape, sex, and pornography through
      Andrea Dworkin’s radical feminist framework. In this piece, “Dworkin (1989) treats
      pornography as a ‘blueprint of male supremacy,’ which provides a privileged site for
      anatomizing, in often excruciating detail, the dynamics of sexual violence (xxxix).”
      Dworkin argues pornography teaches and desensitizes sexual violence and rape. She
      explains how pornography objectifies women and “obscures that objectification behind
      the guise of consent and sexualization.” Essentially, she understands pornography at its
      root as constituting violence against women, shielded by a false narrative of consent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Connecting this to the rise in technology, it is noted that “feminists blamed violence in
      media, and later pornography, for the prevalence of rape, domestic abuse, and sexual
      harassment” (Duberman 2020). Organizations such as Women Against Violence Against
      Women (WAVAW) formed in response to <i>Snuff</i>, a film ending in the seduction and
      murder of an actress. A sister organization, Women Against Violence in Pornography and
      Media (WAVPM), focused specifically on pornography. Following Andrea Dworkin’s
      anti-porn view, WAVPM drew a connection between pornography and violence against
      women. With the help of Catharine MacKinnon, Dworkin helped establish the
      Dworkin-MacKinnon ordinance definition of pornography:
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:18px; font-size:15px;">
      “the graphic, sexually explicit subordination of women in pictures and/or words that also
      includes women presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or
      women presented as sexual objects who enjoy pain or humiliation; or women presented
      as sexual objects who experience sexual pleasure in being raped; or women presented as
      sexual objects tied up or cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt. (Dworkin 1989,
      xxxiii)”
    </p>

    <p>
      To summarize “A New Kind of Death” in the context of this research paper, Rose A.
      Owen’s analysis of pornography through Dworkin’s radical feminist framework views porn
      as “patriarchal violence hidden through consent and sexualization.”
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand Andrea Dworkin’s philosophy, it is useful to turn to her own works. In
      <i>Pornography: Men Possessing Women</i>, she draws an unprecedented parallel between
      women in pornography and Jews in concentration camps, stating, “In contemporary
      American pornography, of course, the Jews do do it to themselves—they, usually female,
      seek out the Nazis, go voluntarily to concentration camps, beg a domineering Nazi to hurt
      them, cut them, burn them—and they do climax, stupendously, to both sadism and death”
      (Dworkin 130). This analogy of women entering pornography as a voluntary concentration
      camp ties into the reinforcement of patriarchal roles: men as the dominant force, women as
      the subordinated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dworkin identifies key themes in pornography: “Male power, as expressed in and through
      pornography, is discernible in discrete but interwoven, reinforcing strains: the power of
      self, physical power over and against others, the power of terror, the power of naming, the
      power of owning, the power of money, and the power of sex” (Dworkin 135). These strains
      are intrinsic to the production of pornography and normalized in media. Another powerful
      analogy she offers is the photograph captioned “BEAVER HUNTERS,” where two white
      men dressed as hunters sit in a black jeep with a white woman tied to the front of the car.
      Naked, twisted, and completely still, she represents the men’s trophy, connecting to the
      power of money, ownership, and sex. The implication is that the “untamed” female is
      dangerous, and must be hunted, possessed, and displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <i>Intercourse</i>, Dworkin offers a radical examination of sex and the role pornography
      plays in shaping sexual dynamics. In the preface, she writes, “Equality in the realm of sex
      is an antisexual idea if sex requires dominance in order to register as sensation.” This
      challenges the assumption that dominance and submission are intrinsic to sex. Dworkin
      argues sexual equality cannot exist if one party must dominate the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      She references <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i>, a book opposing intercourse, especially in marriage.
      Following Pozdnyshev and the events leading to his murder of his wife, the narrative
      illustrates how sex, jealousy, and ownership can turn deadly. Dworkin sees this as an
      example of how sex under patriarchy becomes less about connection and more about
      control and violence. “Any violation of a woman's body can become sex for men; this is
      the essential truth of pornography” (Dworkin). In <i>Intercourse</i>, she critiques a culture that
      eroticizes the domination of women and calls for a reimagining of sex as reciprocal,
      respectful, and egalitarian.
    </p>

    <!-- LITERATURE REVIEW -->
    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
      Reiss and Dahlman’s article “‘I Need You Inside of Me’” analyzes how pornography shapes
      and structures our understanding of bodies, particularly within gender roles. It discusses
      how pornography reinforces traditional ideas such as male domination and female
      submission, but also how pornography can potentially challenge these norms to create more
      equal, respectful, and non-traditional dynamics. “Mainstream porn is, bluntly put, porn
      made by men for men” (Reiss &amp; Dahlman 2024). They argue that most porn is made by
      men for men and reproduces gender inequality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The internet has become the primary distribution channel for pornography, and as it has
      rapidly expanded, mainstream pornography has grown in parallel. Pornography is designed
      to create sexual arousal and profit in an industry largely driven by and catered to a
      male-dominated mass market. Reiss and Dahlman then introduce the idea of feminist
      pornography, centering female lust and desire. They note that “feminist pornography draws
      on principles like authentic and diverse representation of bodies, genders, fantasies, and
      sexuality, and fair-trade production” as an alternative framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      They analyze a specific site called “Erotic Stories” as a case study in feminist pornography.
      “Erotic Stories can thus be seen as yet another commercial organization that rides the wave
      of feminism to position itself in a more politically aware market” (Ciclitira, 2004). Erotic
      Stories differentiates itself in part through its emphasis on audio pornography: there are no
      physical bodies visible on screen, which allows users to rely on imagination and avoid
      objectification of real bodies. In the context of this paper, “‘I Need You Inside of Me’”
      illustrates one way to challenge mainstream patriarchal porn without attempting to abolish
      it entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mitja Sunčič’s “The Porn Drift: Pornography, Technology, and Masturbation” explores how
      technological change reshapes pornography and its relationship to real-life sexual
      experience. Sunčič introduces the concept of “Porn Drift,” describing the disconnect
      between pornography and lived sexual experiences. This helps explain how individuals,
      especially those with limited sexual experience, may form distorted expectations of sex.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sunčič describes how the development of technology enabled “gonzo pornography,” which
      was marketed as more realistic, often shot from a first-person point of view. Yet, in
      attempting to represent the “Real,” gonzo porn intensified degrading and demanding sexual
      acts directed at female performers: “The way gonzo directors pursued the goal of finding
      the Real was by adding more and more intense sexual acts that were often degrading to and
      demanding of the female performers” (Sunčič 61). Some directors openly deprioritized
      women’s pleasure, focusing instead on male gratification. While the gonzo trend claimed to
      bring porn closer to reality, it deepened gender imbalances and normalized male-centric
      power dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sunčič also reflects on the role of the camera: “it would be naïve to believe that the
      camera, as the central technological artifact of the entertainment industry, only captures
      what goes on in the real world. Its role is not the passive one of just a receptor of the real;
      instead, it plays an active role, the role of creating a new, technologically mediated reality”
      (Sunčič 62). Technology, in this sense, not only records but actively shapes and amplifies
      certain sexual scripts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cardoso and Paasonen’s “The Value of Print, the Value of Porn” discusses the role of print
      magazines such as <i>Ménage à trois</i> and <i>Phile</i> in the porn ecosystem, especially from
      queer-feminist perspectives. While most mainstream porn is consumed as online video,
      these magazines work in print and are rooted in a post-pornography ethos. Post-porn “involves
      self-referential play with normalized assumptions of sexual representation and can, to a
      degree, be understood as a reparative approach to pornography” (Albury 2009).
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Ménage à trois</i> and <i>Phile</i> blend photography, comics, drawings, essays, and short
      stories, with a strong artistic focus. Their physical format sets them apart from generic porn
      magazines, subverting expectations around size, layout, and representational conventions.
      The DIY and low-profit nature of these projects further emphasizes that their primary goal
      is not commercial success but artistic exploration and pleasure—often from female and
      queer perspectives. These magazines provide an example of pornography that foregrounds
      alternative desires and communities ignored by mainstream platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, Maria Corsianos’ “Mainstream Pornography and ‘Women’: Questioning Sexual
      Agency” examines whether North American women can achieve sexual agency within a
      patriarchal culture dominated by mainstream pornography. In mainstream porn, “the female
      actors often have long hair, are thin, often Caucasian, ‘young’ (usually between teens and
      30s), have breast implants, wear lingerie, high heels and plenty of makeup” (Corsianos
      2007). Even lesbian porn is frequently directed by men and mirrors the aesthetics and
      dynamics of heterosexual mainstream pornography.
    </p>

    <p>
      Corsianos suggests that few women attempt to redefine or challenge assumptions about
      their sexual desires and performances, and she draws on MacKinnon and Dworkin to argue
      that agency can only be located in resistance. Because pornography reinforces the notion of
      women as objects, some feminists argue all women should reject it. Corsianos also engages
      with the idea of post-feminism—the claim that feminism has “done its job” and is now
      unnecessary—and questions whether such a society is possible without women’s genuine
      sexual agency.
    </p>

    <p>
      She contends that for sexual agency to be realized, the category “woman” would have to
      lose its essentializing qualities, and society would need to move beyond rigid labels like
      “women,” “men,” “straight,” “gay,” and “bi.” Ultimately, she argues that true liberation
      cannot exist within a framework that continues to essentialize and objectify women through
      the lens of mainstream pornography.
    </p>

    <!-- METHODOLOGY -->
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      To analyze how technological change amplifies patriarchal portrayals in porn, I employ an
      intersectional analysis. Christensen and Jensen’s work on “Doing Intersectional Analysis”
      describes intersectional analysis as an approach that must “encompass the interplay between
      structures and institutions at the macro-level, and identities and lived lives at the
      micro-level” (Christensen &amp; Siim, 2006; Jensen, 2006). Intersectionality explores how
      structures of power overlap and interact.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the context of this paper, intersectional analysis helps illuminate the power imbalance in
      gender that produces a male-centric porn industry. A key component of this method is
      attention to life stories: “Prins argues that narratives tell us how people draw on different
      categories in the construction of their life-story” (Christensen &amp; Siim, 2006; Jensen,
      2006). These narratives help map how individuals position themselves and are positioned
      within social categories such as gender, class, and ethnicity.
    </p>

    <p>
      To apply this method, one could examine the life stories of sex workers and consumers.
      For example, a Black, working-class, queer woman would likely navigate the porn industry
      differently than a white, middle-class, heterosexual man. Intersectional analysis also
      foregrounds the experiences of LGBTQ+ performers and people of color, whose labor and
      representation are shaped by intersecting inequalities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Intersectional analysis is particularly useful for understanding gender roles in pornography
      because it addresses the complexity of social dynamics and power imbalances. Unlike
      methods that focus on a single axis of identity, intersectionality considers the multiple
      identities that shape experience. It emphasizes lived experiences, countering the
      dehumanization and stigma often attached to sex work. By listening to sex workers’
      narratives, we can develop a more empathetic understanding of the industry and its
      participants, and better trace how patriarchy, capitalism, and racism structure their
      conditions.
    </p>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The rise of pornography is not just a reflection of sexual tastes but also a mechanism that
      reinforces patriarchal gender norms and the objectification of women. Drawing on Andrea
      Dworkin’s radical feminist theory, this paper has explored how pornography contributes to
      a culture of male dominance, sexual violence, and commodification of women’s bodies.
      Technological acceleration has expanded the reach and normalization of these dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Intersectional analysis shows how gender, race, class, and sexuality shape both the
      production and consumption of pornography. While feminist and post-porn alternatives
      offer more inclusive representations and challenge the mainstream, they remain niche
      compared to the scale and influence of conventional porn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, a comprehensive and destigmatized sex education, paired with continued critical
      engagement with pornography and media, is necessary to address the deep social impacts
      pornography has on gender relations. Without such efforts, porn will continue to act as a
      powerful teacher of hegemonic misogyny.
